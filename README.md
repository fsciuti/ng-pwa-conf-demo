# Ng-PwaConf-Demo

## Development server (without Service Worker)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build PWA

Run `ng build --prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Run PWA

Install http-server (or another local server) with `npm install -g http-server`, run with `http-server -p 8080 -c-1 dist/pwa-conf` and then visit `http://localhost:8080`.
